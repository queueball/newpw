# Overview

`newpw` is a simple strong password generator that can be used to create randomized passwords that fit most password security. The output will generate several
passwords at once in the event that a generated password doesn't meet the criteria for a particular application.

# Notes

There is a dependency on `click`. Proper dependency management is forthcoming.
